# Abstract

In the rapidly evolving field of medical education, the ability to visualize and interact with complex anatomical structures is crucial for deep understanding and effective learning. My project, the "Interactive Augmented Reality Platform for Medical Education," harnesses the power of Augmented Reality (AR) to bring these complex concepts to life. By integrating advanced AR technologies, such as Vuforia and Unity, I have developed a mobile application that allows students to explore detailed 3D models of human anatomy in real-time, directly from their devices.

The application offers both marker-based and markerless AR experiences, enabling students to view and manipulate 3D models in various environments whether it's in a classroom, a lab, or even at home. This flexibility not only enhances engagement but also allows for a more immersive learning experience. The app is designed with the user in mind, focusing on intuitive controls and seamless performance across both iOS and Android platforms. This platform represents a significant step forward in medical education, offering a modern tool that complements traditional learning methods. It has the potential to revolutionize how students interact with educational content, making learning more engaging, accessible, and effective. Through this application, the aim is to bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application, ultimately contributing to the training of more skilled and confident medical professionals.
